# Deep learning for the physical systems
## Assignment-1
1. Solve unconstrained optimization problems using gradient descent method.
2. Solve constrained optimization problem using KKT conditions. Figure whether constarint is active or not using Lagrange multiplier.

## Assignment-2
1. Build polynomial regression problem and then use it to solve simple spring-mass system.
2. Consider multi degree of freedom spring system. Write a program to find the displacement for a given force vector. Do dimensionality reduction using mode shape approach and PCA. Compare the principle directions in both the approaches.

## Assignment-3
1. Implementation of neural network from scratch.Plot MSE vs number of unknown parameters to compare performance of polynomial regression,neural network.
2. Classification problem( Electro-statically actuated switch).
